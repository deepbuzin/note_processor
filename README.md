# Note Processor ðŸ¦œ

This is a companion notebook for [this issue](https://makeai.substack.com/p/connect-the-dots-use-ai-to-link-your) of Make AI, my newsletter about AI-related pet projects.

## Getting started

1. Install LangChain: see [docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/).
2. Read the article, or just click through the [simplified_extractor.ipynb](https://github.com/deepbuzin/note_processor/blob/main/simplified_extractor.ipynb).

Note that you are going to need a bunch of notes to analyze beforehand.
